# Miiker
Mii maker for PC
This simple program lets you create and save Miis on your computer.
##I DO NOT OWN MIIS IN ANY WAY. THEY BELONG TO NINTENDO.

#Installation
Installation is a pretty tough process, but it will eventually become automated.
1. Make a folder in Program Files (C:/Program Files) and name it Miiker
2. Put the Assets folder provided from this repository and put it in the new folder
Now all you need to do is launch the executable.
